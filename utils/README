The scripts in this file have been written to make dealing with the VisDrone
dataset easier and to convert them to a usable format for training YOLOv3.

The resulting data used for training can be downloaded from:
(this is a large file and will take a long time to download)
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N9DRJqtbdpNbSuwtzwGOE1dnCbGY_BEr

This directory should be unzipped and placed in "test_image" 
named "visDrone"

The VisDrone2019-DET dataset is available from this github:
https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset

train, val and test sets should be downloaded and added to the "visDrone" 
folder inside of "test_images".

This will allow the use of these scripts.
